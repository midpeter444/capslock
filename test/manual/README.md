The dojoTest html and js file are meant for basic manual testing using the dojo-release-1.4.1 master tooltip.  To get the tooltip to work, you must download dojo-release-1.4.1 into the capslock/test/lib directory.  It won't work with dojo-1.7.3 (I haven't tried other versions of dojo).

There are three ways to run it - see the instructions in the README in the `test/jasmine` directory of this repo, but substituting `test/manual` where appropriate.

The dojoTest.html and dojoTest.js files are meant for basic manual testing of the capslock functionlaity. I use the dojo-release-1.4.1 "master tooltip".  To get the tooltip to work, you must download dojo-release-1.4.1 into the capslock/test/lib directory.  It won't work with dojo-1.7.3 (I haven't tried other versions of dojo).

There are three ways to run it - see the instructions in the README in the `test/jasmine` directory of this repo, substituting `test/manual` where appropriate.
